# Amazon-Pie-Scrapper 
![action_working](https://github.com/cjvilar/amazon-pie-scrapper/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)

This project uses the Puppeteer Node library to  
get the price of Raspberry Pi 4s scrapped from amazon (US). Not really usefull but
this is to test out automation with GitHub Actions. As I discover things to try I will implement them 
here! 

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
## Usage

Output: Pie_Price.json
